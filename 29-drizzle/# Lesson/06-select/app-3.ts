/*
  SQL Select
  - Drizzle provides you the most SQL-like way to fetch data from your database, while remaining type-safe and composable. It natively supports mostly every query feature and capability of every dialect, and whatever it doesnâ€™t support yet, can be added by the user with the powerful sql operator.
  - For the following examples, define a new table Users with id, name, age

    1. npx drizzle-kit generate
    2. npx drizzle-kit migrate
    3. tsx --watch app.ts


    INSERT INTO USERS (name, age) VALUES 
    ('Dan', 18),
    ('Alex', 22);

********************************

  # Partial select
  -> In some cases, you might want to select only a subset of columns from a table. You can do that by providing a selection object to the .select() method


********************************

  ðŸŽˆ By specifying sql<string>, you are telling Drizzle that the expected type of the field is string.
If you specify it incorrectly (e.g. use sql<number> for a field that will be returned as a string), the runtime value wonâ€™t match the expected type. Drizzle cannot perform any type casts based on the provided type generic, because that information is not available at runtime.

  ðŸŽˆ If you need to apply runtime transformations to the returned value, you can use the .mapWith() method.
